            "{'text': 'after running with the huawei p30 for a year and a half i thought about oneplus when it next came time to upgrade i then started to look at their phones and research oxygenos and liked what i saw i then discovered the nord series midrange handsets with near flagship level features specs and started investing more time into it i found out the latest nord model would release so after weeks of mulling it over and directly comparing the p30 against the nord 2 i decided to take the plunge i took delivery of the phone the next day and set about unboxing and setting it up i was like a kid at christmas the phone came in a nice looking black box with simple blue lines down the side and the oneplus nord branding imprinted on the front when you shine light on the nord lettering and look from a certain angle you can see a multi colour reflection i then unboxed the phone which came with a screen protector preinstalled and a clear rubber case when you set the phone down on a flat surface with the case on and turn on the torch the entire thing lights up around the edges and looks pretty snazzy also included is the 65w charger red usb c cable sim removal tool documents and a very nice letter from oneplus holding the phone in my hand without the case i have to say it feels amazing it s a really comfy phone to hold and unlike any phone i ve held before because of the materials it s made from it s kind of hard to explain but it just feels nice in the hand it s almost like a silky smooth texture with very slight roughness for grip anyway i powered on and set up the phone logged in with my google details ran all the system software updates and installed all my apps i then went to settings to do some tinkering and customise the os to a look and feel of my liking everything is easy to find in the settings and there s a respectable amount of things to customise for the os colours aod fonts wallpapers horizon light for notifications etc as for oxygenos itself i like it very fresh clean and simple and it ll only get better once 12 0 releases it s currently 4 april 2022 as i m writing this and i m still waiting for 12 0 so hopefully it ll be here soon a theme store and more new features will be getting added as far as i m aware just search oxygenos 12 to see the new additions the mediatek dimensity 1200 chipset is as good as any on par qualcomm snapdragon and can handle graphic intensive games like cod mobile with ease no overheating no lag nothing of the sort that i ve noticed the mediatek is a solid performing chipset and the glue that holds everything together great levels of performance with no noticeable frame drops or dips during gameplay or in general daily usage as for the refresh rate the nord 2 might only have 90hz capability and not the 120hz of some flagship models but it s obviously better than 60hz and is pretty much the sweet spot as battery life would suffer under 120hz you can have it in either 90hz or 60hz mode but sometimes the phone will switch between modes depending on the scenario i leave it on 90hz for the most part and it s fine the fhd fluid amoled display with hdr10 makes for impressive viewing sharp looking details vibrant true to life colours which pop nicely you can change vividness in settings and overall just a nice big bright crystal clear viewing experience games tv series movies and youtube all look amazing the 4500mah battery with 65w charging is a godsend and will get you out of a jam for example if you re short on time i ve put the nord 2 on charge at around 15 gone away then come back about 25 minutes later and it s already at 100 they weren t lying about the charging speed awesome camera too shots with the built in sony imx766 exmor sensor look sharp with nice accurate colour and detail however some shots do look washed out night shots look decent but not the best and can look overprocessed and grainy due to the ai scene recongition mode i ll admit i ve been spoiled by the p30 s leica ag camera though one of the best smartphone cameras ever produced so the experience might be different for you depending on what phone you re coming from as for audio i do miss the baked in dolbyatmos audio from the p30 which gave rich detailed and crystal clear sound across the board with several scenario based modes to choose from despite only having the one loudspeaker the nord 2 has arguably worse audio on balance but it does have the benefit of two loudspeakers which does claw back some of that loss all in all there is more than enough with the nord 2 to warrant it as a truly worthy near flagship upgrade from whichever device you re using now like me with the p30 for example i know the standard p30 isn t a flagship nord 2 is a very capable device and has something for everyone with its impressive spec sheet and range of apps and features i ve had the 8gb ram model for 7 months now and its still hitting the high notes like the day i got it i can imagine the 12gb ram variant is basically nord 2 on roids i fully recommend you to get this phone you won t be sorry thanks for taking the time to read this i might come back with edits from time

ever held never mind own it is extremely capable in every aspect and it never fails to perform the most demanding or takes it will suit everyone from the everyday consumer to the power user there is so much to like about it and i would love to share all of my experiences of the device with you with my review of this device pros high res display2 3 day battery0 to 70 in 30 minutessnappy kirin 980 processor2 intuitive unlock methods3 professional cameraswireless chargingip68 water resistancecons high price pointlarge notchbattery the battery for this device is definitely one of the main selling points of the mate 20 pro the outstanding 4 200mah battery has been fitted in this device which is pretty amazing when you consider how thin it is and what the competition is putting in their devices the large cell certainly pays off with heavy usage the average user will be able to squeeze 2 if not 3 days of moderate use from this device this is a big leap from other competitors and is just one of the many advantages the mate 20 pro has charging i felt the need to include this as a separate topic as the charging speed on this device is in a league of its own the stellar 40w fast charger provided with the device gets the device up to a comfortable percentage super quickly bearing in mind that the device has a large 4200mah battery it manages to charge from 0 to 70 in under 30 minutes this is pretty spectacular and the fastest speed you will find on any flagship device personally i found this to be my favourite feature on this device camera just like the p20 pro the camera is also one of the main features of this device it takes what the p20 pro did and builds upon it by swapping the useless monochrome lens and provides a 12mp super wide angle lens instead this is extremely useful and a change that i am personally glad that huawei made i find myself using this lens almost as much as the main one as it fits so much into the frame otherwise the 40mp main shooter is super crisp and provides so much detail it is one of the best smartphone cameras on the market along with the likes of google and samsung this is another feature which defines a phone as high end instead of mid range 3d face unlock and in screen fingerprint scanner while the in screen fingerprint sensor is not exactly a step up from traditional scanners in terms of speed it certainly is when it comes to style it makes it possible for the mate 20 pro to avoid any rear scanner while leaving as much room for the screen as possible while it isn t 100 accurate i found myself using it more than i expected to when it doesn t work that s when the 3d ir face scanner shows its accuracy and power it is super quick and generally doesn t allow you a chance to view the lock screen as it turns on so quick speed the kirin 980 chip is by far the fastest processor in any phone currently while it may be superseded by the upcoming snapdragon 855 it is unlikely to bring much improved speeds over this chip it is blazingly fast and i am yet to experience any stutter at all it is powerful enough for all games i have tested and i have yet to find an app where it doesn t perform better than any of its competitors the processor also does a great job of preserving battery by forcing intensive apps to close the clever machine learning algorithms are great at only closing what is not used and i found it keeping my most used apps consistently open while closing unnecessary ones software while emui is known to be quite a heavy experience over stock android i have found the largest version which runs pie from the box to be super refined compared to emui 8 on my previous p20 the experience is a whole lot smoother and a pleasure to use they have made many small tweaks which overall translates to a much more refined experience like always i love huawei s stunning pictures used as themes throughout the interface and i really welcome the ease of navigation through apps and settings while not perfect i find the whole experience more and more like ios by the update not a bad thing at all price this is an important topic to discuss as the price will obviously be an important factor for most at 899 it isn t exactly cheap however it is exactly in line with there the high end phone market is at at the moment 899 is very reasonably priced and it is easy to see how the production cost is so high when looking at the amount of tech they crammed into this device however if that price is too much to swallow i highly recommend taking a look at the mate 20 pro s brother the mate 20 this can be found for 600 and boasts many similar features as the mate 20 pro so it is worth taking a look at that also goes for the mate 20x which has a whopping 7 2 inch display which may be a bit much to handle for some but attractive for others other features the most notable added feature is the ability to wirelessly charge other devices supporting the qi standard this feature is a pretty nifty party trick and works pretty well there are also a couple of other cool features such as the wireless desktop projection via miracast this is pretty cool and really handy for projecting stuff from your phone direct to your t v another cool thing you can do with your t v is control it with the ir blaster fixed to the front of the phone the last notable mention is the inclusion of ip68 water resistance this means that your phone will easily survive a dunk in the pooling i think it s a feature huawei made a great decision to add overall there is so much to like about this phone and very little to be wanted the whole experience is so enjoyable and every aspect of the interface is so snappy and refined that it is hard to find flaws while there are small things which could be improved on most of them are software related which i have no doubt that huawei is working to improve all the time these are small trade offs to be able to own arguably the best phone on the market hands down the best phone of 2018 for me

mins or so for an all day event work knowing that your phone is at 5 or so due to forgetting to charge it in just 10 20 mins of charging the phones battery will go from 5 in my example to 50 plus easily for peace of mind alone it s one of the features i love the most the 90hz refresh rate on the screen is also fantastic and really doesn t dent the battery life all that much i m not a heavy user but do spend a lot of time on twitter and reddit when commuting to and from work i came from a pixel 2 xl which was having an issue with it s battery charging port which was driving me nuts especially as i am very forgetful when it comes to remembering to charge the thing i had to hold the charger in the port and keep pressure on it just to charge camera wise it s not as good as the pixel but to honest you d have to look pretty close to see a huge difference the front camera pops up for selfies if that s your thing as well as for facial recognition i tested dropping the phone on to my sofa with the camera out and it will instantly go back in if it senses that the phone is falling which is a great little feature price wise it really is value for money as you will be paying a lot more for the features that this device has when compared to other flagship devices the oled screen also look incredible compared to my previous pixel xl 2\",\n          \"i bought this phone to replace an aging but well served nokia 8 i was totally bamboozled by the plethora of internet reviews about the best mid priced smartphone but had got it down to a choice of two so i decided to keep to a strict budget therefore based on the price operating system features and my simple usage i plumbed for this the oneplus nord 2t the phone promptly arrived and a lot of it s features given good words by amazon customers reviews were proven to be very accurate the operating system is android 12 and the one plus ui overlay is pretty none intrusive over the general order of things the battery lasted impressively considering the amount of use for installing configuring and generally setting everything up i would say i m an average user and the battery lasted generally 2 days i think this is good seeing as it is a modern phone and has a lot to do charging time was a remarkable step up but i m of the make a brew whilst it s charging frame of mind so it s no biggie it is fast taking 0 to charged in roughly half an hour the screen is very good indeed and has loads of settings that i m still getting used to the clarity of it struck me most and contrary to what anyone says 90hz refresh rate is fab considering the size of the screen the camera has loads of settings too but i m very impressed with what i have seen so far the phone itself comes with a case screen protector already fitted and is a very sleek modern design i opted to buy an extra cover and some tempered glass screen protectors as i know it may come across a set of keys in my pocket i particularly like the on screen finger print reader as it actually works i took a tip from a previous reviewer and used my middle finger to set it up due to cuts and knocks on my index finger and thumb all in all i would say that if you would like a reasonably cheap phone by today s standards with a load of neat features dead easy to use looks and feels great with a nifty bit of camera to boot then you won t go far wrong with one of these by the way don t fuss over lack of ip rating as you re not that daft to bury it in sand or go swimming with it are you\",\n          \"i bought this phone as my old oneplus 5 was showing its age and barely working anymore i ve only had it for 2 days but so far i am impressed with how good it is the display looks good and is bright enough for sunny days it s responsive and the refresh rate makes it snappy the cameras are of decent quality but i m less interested in this as i use a dslr for taking pictures but overall the quality of the pictures is acceptable and much better than that of my old phone charging is blistering fast and you can also use wireless charging charger not included i can t say much about the battery life as i ve only received the phone a couple of days ago but it lasted a full day easily and with a top up of 10 minutes it will last even more the design of the phone is nice and the materials used feel premium and fingerprint resistant other than the camera which is a fingerprint magnet keep in mind that the finish is very slippery in the box there is a charger rubber case which is good quality and the usual stuff such as manuals stickers and sim tool the phone comes with a pre applied screen protector\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"battery\",\n
